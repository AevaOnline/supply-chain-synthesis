**STATUS: RAW IMPORT - PLEASE EDIT**

As I have interviewed stakeholders across companies and OSS foundations, each
leading efforts to address the recent Executive Order on software supply chain
security, I have not yet encountered an articulation of a holistic overview of
the problem domain. As such, this seemed a worthwhile undertaking -- even if
another such effort exists elsewhere, and I have merely not chanced upon it
yet, surely this exercise will generate some valuable insights along the way
there.

This document seeks to capture the breadth of activity happening in software
supply chain security domain, solicit feedback from various stakeholders,
inspire reflection and develop a shared perspective on the totality of work
across both corporate interests and the public domain, and arrive at agreement
on specific areas where an increase in collaboration and/or funding would have
the greatest benefit to all.

A [Meta Analysis of the Problem Domain](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KFEv8Th3XRHzj73FRG_x_drfyYmoiWG0th9WollOvTE/edit?usp=sharing)
has been pulled into a separate document, so this one may focus on the
practicalities of enumerating work efforts and generating lexical mappings of
the work.
