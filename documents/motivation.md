# Why this project, and why now?

## A surge in attention

Driven by events such as high-profile software supply chain attacks and policy developments that garner media coverage, the concept of the **software supply chain** and the problem of _securing_ it has been introduced to laypeople at an unprecedented pace, creating an opportunity window for the industry to accelerate the outcomes of our collective efforts.

This has brought increased attention from non-practitioner decision makers, such as business leaders and policymakers, who are looking for common frameworks to understand how it impacts their areas of responsibility and value creation.

This has also brought increased attention from practitioners in the software industry that, while familiar with some of the underlying risks and principles, perceive the mainstream attention as a call for urgent action. This surge in attention from the public can't be taken for granted; high cognitive load might lead to attention fatigue at the cost of losing end users as allies.

## A surge in creation and investment

The novelty that comes with more audiences getting exposed to the term can mask the fact that conceptual models, taxonomies, technologies, organizations, investments and other resources related to or impacting the software supply chain security have existed for a long time. However, the prior art has accumulated over time, from different domains and with different motivations.

For example, when practitioners and non-practitioners search for information on _software supply chain security_ they are exposed to content that emanates from disciplines such as information security, supply chain management, software engineering, embedded systems, applied cryptography, threat management and a long etcetera, cutting across the public, private, defense and academic sector in every vertical and geography imaginable.

What's most important, though, is that what we have is not enough for the threat complexity and sophistication of the future. We are learning about new vectors from live attacks faster than we can theorize and inventory them, and the prevalence of open source software in organizations of all types and in technology solutions with high societal impact calls for an evolved approach.

There are four main elements of the current explosion of ideas and value creation surge:

1. Practitioners across domains are rapidly prototyping ideas, often packaged as open source software, and communicating this across open communities
2. Already existing solutions in established domains are being reevaluated with a different perspective and in some case adapted to work in broader scenarios
3. Private (VC) investment in startups and other ventures that are primarily specializing in software supply chain security remains timid, especially when compared to other startup specialization areas, but has started to materialize
4. Large software companies are funding industry-wide initiatives, organizations and programs specifically to tackle software supply chain security challenges

As public attention surges, the flourishing of many new ideas is a net positive for supply chain security, but coordination challenges abound. These coordination challenges include poor reusability across use cases and scenarios due to siloed design choices, aggressive pace of change that breaks business continuity or creates operational risk, and hinderance of adoption and outcomes due to poor interoperability.

While there are multiple factors contributing to these challenges, we believe that by drawing attention to the commonalities and differences in terminology, approaches and technology can provide transparency and possibly a common framework for understanding across participants.
