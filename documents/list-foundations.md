Much work is already underway in non-profit consortia, industry groups, and standards bodies. In this section, we should enumerate all public domain work relevant here, whether its form is discussions, code, standards, or other.

This section describes the foundation or public entity wherein working groups are gathering, and should list such items as: mailing lists, slack channels, websites, and publications. Please list code projects in the following section.

-   Open Container Initiative (OCI): ...
-   Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF): 
    -   Various working groups & discussions
    -   Has published several recommendations for OSS project health
        -   Eg <https://github.com/ossf/scorecard>
        -   <https://metrics.openssf.org>
    -   Created some code to provide analysis capabilities to the public (e.g, scoring project criticality and health)
-   Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF):
    -   JenkinsX: ...
    -   [Tekton Chains](https://cd.foundation/blog/2021/06/18/verifiable-supply-chain-metadata-for-tekton/)
-   IETF " Remote ATtestation procedureS" Working Group (RATS WG): 
    -   <https://github.com/ietf-rats>

    -   Security TAG software supply chain Working Group
        -   How to join: see [Meeting Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/170y5biX9k95hYRwprITprG6Mc9xD5glVn-4mB2Jmi2g)
        -   "[Best Practices for Build Processes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1twMD8ztZQMwV4nPJZWVXpg6YCckBkUI5lbyHBoHcbRo/edit#heading=h.6arp2l6mbvj7)"
        -   STAG [Secure Supply Chain Security Paper](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper/sscsp.md) (finalized / v1.0)
        -   Work underway to create Reference Architecture for "Secure Software Factory" (ETA: October). [Meetings weekly](https://docs.google.com/document/d/170y5biX9k95hYRwprITprG6Mc9xD5glVn-4mB2Jmi2g).
    -   Several CNCF projects which support supply chain security may also be applicable outside of CNCF
    -   Confidential Container [project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1thHNIWUhU8d5zzRVA9IFWXstx-IA0TK3WKG_hgkK1Ak/edit) under review
-   Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC)
    -   Libraries for hardware attestation, projects for utilizing TEEs to create secure build environments, provide non-repudiation of developer identity, and integrity guarantees on execution environments
    -   White papers on use 
    -   Some CC projects are being used as a framework for SSC work, such as [CCF](https://github.com/Microsoft/CCF) → [SCIM](https://github.com/microsoft/scim)
-   Open Infra Foundation (OIF)
    -   Kata Containers: active work to leverage TEEs to provide 'confidential container' components
    -   Kata may be used by Kubernetes, as with CC projects above, to provide additional security guarantees to a software supply chain
-   Linux Kernel
    -   Active work to harden guests against host ("type 3 isolation"), which could provide a mechanism for secure build environments
