# Mapping the supply chain security domain

This is work in progress, and thus incomplete.

## Synthesized views

* [Landscape view: formats, artifacts, tools, identity, and storage](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1H0B9oKP_WN6wNlLqUjlVxC4PYLMzuDk002PfYJ0lyz4/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Mapping roles by proximity to software generation](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/14mi30Gd45RNCguXjgBdYb9TNhNxIFTJuyZjdyPWJBHc/edit)

## Prior art, mostly domain-specific

* CNCF: The Secure Software Factory
  * [Landing page](https://thesecuresoftwarefactory.github.io/ssf/)
  * [Reference architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FwyOIDramwCnivuvUxrMmHmCr02ARoA3jw76o1mGfGQ/edit)
  * [Prototype implementation](https://github.com/thesecuresoftwarefactory/ssf)
    * There have been plenty of alternative e2e poc implementations in this space, a few are listed below:
      * Michael Lieberman's [supply-chain-examples](https://github.com/thesecuresoftwarefactory/ssf) (formerly at [mlieberman85/supply-chain-examples](https://github.com/mlieberman85/supply-chain-examples))
