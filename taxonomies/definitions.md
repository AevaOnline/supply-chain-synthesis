# Definitions

The knowledge domain of this effort is dubbed _software supply chain security_.

While most practitioners have an intuitive grasp of what the "software supply chain" looks like, and what "securing it" might entail, there's plenty of variation in the specifics that prevent a single definition from arising.

Furthermore, discussions of such a definition necessarily introduce more concepts and terms of art from different domains which we believe are worth compiling in this page.

In this page, it's our preference to link to existing definitions particularly if there are several conflicting ones, in order to draw attention to the divergences and commonalities.
